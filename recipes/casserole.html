        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Cook the Chicken:</strong>
                Simmer chicken in a large pot with water until it's no longer pink
                 inside, about 15 minutes. Shred the chicken.
                If you're using leftover chicken or rotisserie chicken, 
                simply shred it (no need to cook it again,
                 it will warm up in the oven).
                </li>
            <li><strong>Make the Soup Base:</strong>
                Mix the cream of mushroom soup with the mayonnaise.</li> 
            <li><strong>Assemble the Casserole:</strong>
                Combine the soup mixture with the chicken, broccoli, and 
                Cheddar cheese. Transfer it to a 9x13-inch baking dish and 
                top with the stuffing mix.
                </li>
            <li><strong>Bake the Casserole:</strong>
                Bake in a 350 degree F oven for about 25-30 minutes,
                 until the stuffing is golden brown.
                </li>           
        </ol>
